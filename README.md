# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Case Study

Author: Lynne Vo

The final project for the course Google Data Analytics on Coursera

The last part of the course requires students to finish a capstone project to apply skills that I have learnt throughout the course. This project is about “How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?”. The analysis process will go through 5 phases: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act:

- **Ask**: business understanding (identify the business task, consider key stakeholders)

- **Prepare**: prepare data for analysis (store data, identify how it’s organized, sort and filter data, determine the credibility of the data)

- **Process**: cleaning or manipulation of data (check the data for errors, transform the data)

- **Analyze**: get the insights of data (organize and format your data, make some computations, identify trends and relationships)

- **Share**: create visualizations and list key findings

- **Act**: top three recommendations

R is used for preparation, cleaning and analysis. Tableau is for the visualisation.
